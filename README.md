# Missile Command Clone (Console Edition)

This is a C++ remake of the classic **Missile Command**, brought to life in a Windows console.

## How to Run

This project uses raw Windows headers like `<windows.h>` and `<conio.h>`, so itâ€™s **Windows-only**. No bloated Visual Studio project files required.
Run the .exe to launch, or compile it yourself
